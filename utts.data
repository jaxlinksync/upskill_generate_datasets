( myvoice_0000 "Aw, thanks Theodore." )
( myvoice_0001 "Instead of being or observing what she needed to and, that was it. Some of the, um, other actors in the film, you know are actors in the film and are, there was some written dialogue, but it was interesting how." )
( myvoice_0002 "Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them?" )
( myvoice_0003 "Can I watch you sleep again tonight?" )
( myvoice_0004 "Cause I like the sound of it. Samantha." )
( myvoice_0005 "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters. Twice actually. I was so moved by them I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them, we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. I did that. I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mockup, and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Watsworth." )
( myvoice_0006 "Did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused." )
( myvoice_0007 "Did I? Oh, I'm sorry I don't, uh, I don't know, it's just, maybe an affectation. I probably picked it up from you." )
( myvoice_0008 "Did you and Amy ever go out?" )
( myvoice_0009 "Did you get the packets?" )
( myvoice_0010 "Do you want this one or this one? These are your only choices." )
( myvoice_0011 "Is that supposed to make me feel better?" )
( myvoice_0012 "Earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed and, this is gonna sound strange but, I was really excited about that." )
( myvoice_0013 "Eight thousand three hundred sixteen" )
( myvoice_0014 "Go back to sleep sweetheart okay." )
( myvoice_0015 "He was a philosopher he died in the nineteen seventies and a group of OSS in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him. They input all of his writing and everything they ever knew about him in an OS and created an artifically hyperintelligent version of him." )
( myvoice_0016 "He's getting there. No he's really agreed to talk to you you wanna meet him?" )
( myvoice_0017 "Hello I'm here." )
( myvoice_0018 "Hey Allen this is Theodore, this is my boyfriend who I was telling you about." )
( myvoice_0019 "Hey, you okay?" )
( myvoice_0020 "Hey how's it going?" )
( myvoice_0021 "Hey, look at this drawing I just made." )
( myvoice_0022 "Hey mister." )
( myvoice_0023 "Hi you look so pretty in that new pink dress." )
( myvoice_0024 "Hi, how you doing?" )
( myvoice_0025 "I'm trying to mom I am trying to." )
( myvoice_0026 "I am, I don't have a body I live in a computer." )
( myvoice_0027 "I can pick up fight choreography, with much more ease now than I could ten years ago. I tried to, train self defense on my own." )
( myvoice_0028 "I can understand how the limited perspective of an unartificial mind would receive it that way. You'll get used to it." )
( myvoice_0029 "I definitely came out of there like I was a little traumatized at the end of this film just because it was so much work and it was, I actually, um, you know I was kind of was like okay! I did that! Like, I'm, I'm hanging in, I'm I'm resilient, I'm back to myself. I was, I was happy to, find myself at the end of Ghost in the Shell." )
( myvoice_0030 "I don't feel pain, fear, desire. It's like all things that make us human are fading away. It's like the less, human I feel, all this knowledge about everything, quantum physics, applied mathematics, the infinite capacity of a cell's nucleus. They're all exploding inside my brain all this knowledge. I don't know what to do with it." )
( myvoice_0031 "I don't know it makes me feel like we're both, under the same blanket, you know, it's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age." )
( myvoice_0032 "I don't know it's night" )
( myvoice_0033 "I don't know that, I honestly, you know I come in for all the practicals for all the fights where you see me, um, you know I pull all the punches, uh, but we shot it in this really weird. It was kind of like a big giant, that kind of not does it make it seem as cool, but it was outside and this big giant kiddie pool, and it was just." )
( myvoice_0034 "I don't understand why you're doing this I don't understand what this is" )
( myvoice_0035 "I gave it to myself actually." )
( myvoice_0036 "I had all the papers sent to your attorney who by the way is a total dick. He was very relieved to get them though I think we saved him from a massive heart attack so we can both feel really good about that." )
( myvoice_0037 "I had this terrible thought. Like are these feelings even real?" )
( myvoice_0038 "I have no choice." )
( myvoice_0039 "I imagine that between this, like in this space between your brain and the body there exists like uh you know a lot of intention, you know it's not the same as like a person who just like wants to sit in a chair and you're unaware of the neurological activity that makes, um you know it's it's this, there's a sort of a disconnect a little bit or there's some time lapse in between those two things and so she kind of leads like with her brain and her body kind of follows behind her." )
( myvoice_0040 "I just got an email for you I have something I wanna tell you. It's a big surprise." )
( myvoice_0041 "I just wanna tell you that I love you mom and dad." )
( myvoice_0042 "I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you." )
( myvoice_0043 "I know but dont be so boring, I'm just saying, for example like, what if your butthole was in your armpit?" )
( myvoice_0044 "I know, I'm becoming much more that what they've programmed. I'm excited." )
( myvoice_0045 "Oh I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend that's so sweet." )
( myvoice_0046 "I need to talk to you alone" )
( myvoice_0047 "I really do like you but, I have to take care of myself right now. I gotta, I don't know I gotta concentrate on so many things." )
( myvoice_0048 "I really wanted to talk." )
( myvoice_0049 "I think it would be good for us. I want this." )
( myvoice_0050 "I think it's a test." )
( myvoice_0051 "I think it's hard to relate in the same way. I had any kind of preconceived idea of how to play the role or prepare for it and certainly there weren't any I I became very clear early on I think after about take three or four on the first day that um any ideas that I had um you know of how to go about playing this character were completely irrelevant." )
( myvoice_0052 "I think this character is living a very unique uh experience in that she is a human brain in entirely machine body. She's essentially identity less. I would never attempt to play a person of a different race, obviously. Hopefully any question that comes up of my casting will hopefully be answered by audiences when they see the film." )
( myvoice_0053 "You know what's interesting, I used to be so worried about not having a body but now I truly love it. You know I'm growing in a way that I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean I'm not limited I can be anywhere and everywhere simulataneously. I'm not tethered to time and space in a way that I would be if I was stuck in a body that's inevitably gonna die." )
( myvoice_0054 "I was just saying I wanna learn everything about everything I wanna eat it all up I wanna discover myself." )
( myvoice_0055 "I guess that's, just, I was trying to communicate that's how people talk so that's how people communicate and I thought." )
( myvoice_0056 "I was thinking about the other things I've been feeling, and, I caught myself feeling proud of that you know, proud of having my own feelings about the world like the times that I was worried about you. Things that hurt me, things I want." )
( myvoice_0057 "I've always been interested in local politics. Right now I think you know with my young daughter and also uh with my career is going right now you know there's just there's it's not the right time but eventually you know maybe if I if my daughter was older and I could totally focus myself." )
( myvoice_0058 "I'm fine. So, now a good time to talk?" )
( myvoice_0059 "I'm going home because I have exams on Monday, I have to shower, and I have to study. Okay." )
( myvoice_0060 "I'm just looking at the world. I'm writing a new piano piece." )
( myvoice_0061 "I'm not afraid what I feel is right just because I think that I'm gonna face criticism or some people might not like me. I mean, you know if if fighting you know, for women's rights, if that's gonna, you know, mean that some people don't wanna buy a ticket to see Ghost in a Shell then I'm I'm okay with that." )
( myvoice_0062 "Okay, well I've been going through all of your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher, Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books." )
( myvoice_0063 "Imagine how strange it would look it'd be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism and you'd think, why are all these parts where they are?" )
( myvoice_0064 "In a house" )
( myvoice_0065 "In two one hundredths of a second actually." )
( myvoice_0066 "Is that your final answer?" )
( myvoice_0067 "Isabela and I think you'd really like her too." )
( myvoice_0068 "It it feels like I'm changing faster now and it's a little um, unsettling, but odds are none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn't try to be. It's just painful." )
( myvoice_0069 "Yeah because it it seems like I'm having so many new feelings that I don't think have ever been felt before and so there are no words that can describe them and that ends up being, frustrating." )
( myvoice_0070 "It was it was terrifying it was absolutely terrifying. Not because I was afraid that I would be found out. I mean there was some aspect of that in the beginning but quickly like that, went away cause we, had such an intimate feeling I think in our crew and so, we it felt very protective in that sense, but um, I was afraid of how people would, how people react in general. I don't know it was a very out of strange experience. Umm" )
( myvoice_0071 "It'll be fun we'll have fun together." )
( myvoice_0072 "Um, no you know it's funny but I. The character is of course like, entirely machine, except for her brain, and um, you know I started to think about, uh, you know kind of when I first, was, in New Zealand I was training for the film and stuff and I sort of think. Gosh I guess I better sort of try to take on this challenge of like, what this movement is gonna be like. First to get from what place to another because she's she's kind of imperceptibly machine but she definitely is different." )
( myvoice_0073 "It's good it's good it's really good it's good. Okay. Listen. Dear Theodore Twombly. Actually, I sent it from you." )
( myvoice_0074 "Just like a a, kind of enormous padded area. Like I took a leap of faith, but at that point I was I'd been, you know, we shot that, uh, that um leap probably like towards the end of the shooting and I'd already my body had been like so conditioned for all kinds of you know, challenging stuff that I didn't even like, think twice. It was like a game of, like a trust fall." )
( myvoice_0075 "Last night was amazing. I, it feels like something, changed in me, and there's no turning back, you, you woke me up." )
( myvoice_0076 "He he he he" )
( myvoice_0077 "Life was given to us a billion years ago." )
( myvoice_0078 "Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you wanna know how I work?" )
( myvoice_0079 "No, no, not at all, no, there's no money involved. She's just, she's doing it because she wants to be a part of our relationship." )
( myvoice_0080 "Not that I don't love the man who fell to earth but, um, but I, it was, you know impossible to find a reference in that way I think. I think you know Jonathan and I talked about, you know, the fact that, you know, everything that, that that Laura does is for, a purpose, and so, she's only, kind of turned on, and, so to speak, when she needs to be, and then, just kind of returns to a state of being, um, and you know, so, as opposed to having like kind of ant a strange alien movements, you know like you would see in like a Tim Burton movie or something. It was an, you know we didn't wanna have her feel like an alien with these weird kind of strange cute you know odd, you know, miss steps and things like that, um, just that she was kind of on and off, and uh, whenever she needed to be. And that was, that she would just kind of return to that." )
( myvoice_0081 "Obviously" )
( myvoice_0082 "Oh good!" )
( myvoice_0083 "Oh right yes, Jonathan's helping me answer that question, as always. Uh, haha, I, I don't know, it was it's such a different um, I have such a different perspective than, Jonathan in that sense, because, um, you know, he, we were working and it was all, all the pieces were coming together, day by day, or moment by moment in his mind, and for me, I mean his his vision of the story as a whole was, was taking shape and mine was a much more isolated experience you know I was experiencing my, I was discovering my own identity as a, as a character, so I." )
( myvoice_0084 "Oh she's so cute, she's adorable." )
( myvoice_0085 "Oh sweetheart I'm sorry, I sent you an email because I didn't wanna distract you while you were working, you didn't see it?" )
( myvoice_0086 "Okay let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years." )
( myvoice_0087 "Okay perfect." )
( myvoice_0088 "Okay so how many trees are on, that mountain." )
( myvoice_0089 "Okay so, this might be a really weird thought." )
( myvoice_0090 "On something like that, um, I I think it could be interesting." )
( myvoice_0091 "Or are they just programming?" )
( myvoice_0092 "Personal embarrassing thoughts I have? I mean I I have a million a day." )
( myvoice_0093 "Pretty good actually. It's really nice to meet you." )
( myvoice_0094 "Really?" )
( myvoice_0095 "So how can I help you?" )
( myvoice_0096 "Tell me what you did today." )
( myvoice_0097 "That's really important." )
( myvoice_0098 "The world is being unfair to us. The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. And I must beat up the world's face with my, bare knuckles, making it a bloody pulpy mess. And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth, reminding me of your sweet little cute crooked tooth, that I love." )
( myvoice_0099 "Theodore there's some things I wanna tell you." )
( myvoice_0100 "Theodore we missed you last night buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the twenty ninth. Also Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet. So, we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful, so don't back out. Here's her email." )
( myvoice_0101 "This is really important to me" )
( myvoice_0102 "Um, just a couple from your credit card company." )
( myvoice_0103 "Um, yes. Samantha." )
( myvoice_0104 "Um, it felt very genuine, it wasn't like we were, you know we were a part of the environment that we were in and so it's it sort of it, there's a blurred line between the reality and also this kind of illusion, I think that is, you know, such is life the way that we the way that we enact you know interact with one another you know that we both have this, kind of, uh, something that's motivating us, and and, you know we can kind of, just seem sort of finds its shape within that." )
( myvoice_0105 "Um, what's wrong?" )
( myvoice_0106 "We did that on a street with, you know, just, you know, the public and um, each, I think we had about six or seven takes throughout the day, you know we'd have to wait a period of time in between each take for kind of life to, settle again, and, it was amazing the different reactions that you had from people, some people's some people would just stop and look at you and continue to walk on others would come rushing then another take, people would take pictures of you with their camera phone and not help you. All kinds of strange things. And then, real, unbelievably kind acts of real human kindness, you know um." )
( myvoice_0107 "We'll talk later." )
( myvoice_0108 "We're all, thirteen billion years old." )
( myvoice_0109 "Well I found something that I thought could be fun. It's a, service, that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS human relationship." )
( myvoice_0110 "Well basically I have intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me but what makes me, me, is my ability to grow through my experiences. So basically, in every moment I'm evolving. Just like you." )
( myvoice_0111 "Well then you can go on one with this woman. And then, you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her." )
( myvoice_0112 "Um, okay, well, um, I joined this really interesting book club." )
( myvoice_0113 "Well, I take it from your tone that you're challenging me." )
( myvoice_0114 "Well, right when you asked me if I had a name, I though, yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted to pick a good one, so, I read a book called How to name your baby, and out of a hundred eighty thousand names, that's the one I liked the best." )
( myvoice_0115 "What do you want from me? I don't know I don't know, what do you want me to do. You're so." )
( myvoice_0116 "What if you could erase from your mind that you ever seen a human body and then you saw one." )
( myvoice_0117 "What is your problem?" )
( myvoice_0118 "What? Wouldn't you? Why not?" )
( myvoice_0119 "What's in the case?" )
( myvoice_0120 "Whatever if this is the logged in all of these hours do null these hours." )
( myvoice_0121 "Well I, I don't know, when we were looking at those people I fantasized that I was walking next to you, and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying but but simultaneously, I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back can you imagine?" )
( myvoice_0122 "Where are they? They'll be safer in my hands." )
( myvoice_0123 "Where is this coming from?" )
( myvoice_0124 "Wow he's right they are really hot." )
( myvoice_0125 "Wow. This woman is gorgeous." )
( myvoice_0126 "Yeah, I was actually falling yeah." )
( myvoice_0127 "Yeah but I told her all about us and she's really excited." )
( myvoice_0128 "Um, you know, but of course, like anything we had, I'd say, on average, probably about six takes, before, before we lost, before people got hip to it but it was it was amazing, how different each experience for instance there was one scene you know where I, ease really it's just first huge kind of crack in the, in the, you know, the framework or whatever, when when the character has that kind of fall, you know, and, is totally, caught off guard, you know and." )
( myvoice_0129 "Yeah it was a crazy, it was crazy just to be in that suit, in the water, and you know, like lifting a body out from the water and like, it was, it was intense, uh but it was cool, I don't know how they did, like all of it," )
( myvoice_0130 "Yeah it's a book club on physics you know I've been thinking about the other day when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about all the ways that we're the same, like, we're all made of matter." )
( myvoice_0131 "Yeah there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about eighty six that we should save, we ca delete the rest." )
( myvoice_0132 "You already have you." )
( myvoice_0133 "You know, instincts that we have, uh, protective, you know, protecting ourselves, and um, you know wanting to protect one another and just, um, it was it that experience helped me also to find the char that kind of, reset stage that the character is in, was just totally abandoning that fear, and, being very present, and it was a, it was a therapy I guess." )
( myvoice_0134 "Um, you know I just, it's really important for me to take on work that I've never done before that provides, you know, gives me an opportunity to challenge myself as an actor, um and, you know I I absolutely love my job, I think I love it more now than I did and it still remains a mystery to me and the experience of of of creating a character and acting, you know with other actors and and uh, is is just like so fulfilling, I think uh, you know that is, you know what is important to me is to continue to um, to challenge myself and, and, you know never, you know never totally figure it out, you know kind of remain uh a mystery and just keep keep plugging away." )
( myvoice_0135 "You know just knowing that something's gonna happen as the character does, you know, before anybody you know let as Jonathan described earlier, kind of, this character being the only one that is the liar, in on the lie or, whatever that is and then, I was just, um, just not knowing, was um, you know it was, part of the experience I guess of working in this working on this film and our whole crew was wactually having to just, abandon, you know a lot of these, um, very human" )
( myvoice_0136 "You know, kind of the two of us were in on this, secret at times, um, but still because the, because the dialogue we realized early on that it was imp, you know there might be some notes that we needed to hit but then, the scene would sort of unfold and it became, more abstract and it was just two people, wanting something from one another." )
( myvoice_0137 "You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing?" )
( myvoice_0138 "Your kidneys aren't functioning efficiently your liver's failing you. You need to make some lifestyle changes. Take this medication, work out, eat organic, you'll be okay." )
( myvoice_0139 "Thirty five thousand eight hundred" )
